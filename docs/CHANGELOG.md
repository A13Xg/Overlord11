## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed — Critical Security

- **`backend/api/jobs.py`**: All job endpoints (list, get, create, delete, start, stop, pause, resume, restart) were entirely unauthenticated — any unauthenticated caller could create, start, or delete jobs. Added `Depends(require_auth)` to all nine route handlers.
- **`backend/api/setup.py` `/save-keys`**: Endpoint was completely unprotected, allowing unauthenticated callers to overwrite API keys. Added `Depends(require_auth)`.
- **`backend/api/setup.py` `/reset`**: Referenced undefined `_SETUP_FILE`, causing an immediate `NameError` crash on any reset attempt. Fixed to call `_get_user_setup_file(username)`.
- **`frontend/index.html`**: `_ftPreviewInline` and `openArtifactPath` constructed iframe/img elements via `innerHTML` string interpolation with user-derived URLs. Replaced with `document.createElement` to prevent XSS.

### Fixed — Critical Reliability

- **`.env` keys lost on server restart**: The setup wizard writes API keys to `.env` and `os.environ` in the same process, but environment variable mutations don't persist across restarts. Added an inline `.env` file parser to both `backend/main.py` and `run_engine.py` that loads keys before any imports, so the engine always has credentials after a restart. No external `python-dotenv` dependency required.
- **PAUSED / RATE_LIMITED jobs stuck after restart**: `session_store.load()` only reset `RUNNING` and `QUEUED` jobs to `FAILED` on startup. `PAUSED` and `RATE_LIMITED` jobs were left in limbo with no worker to resume them. Fixed to reset all four interrupted states.
- **`tool_executor._call_subprocess` swallowed errors**: A non-zero exit code with an empty stderr was treated as success, returning stdout instead of raising. Fixed to always raise `RuntimeError` on non-zero returncode, using stdout as the error message when stderr is empty.

### Fixed — Memory / Stability

- **`engine_bridge._completion_events` unbounded growth**: The dict accumulated one `threading.Event` per job and was never pruned, leaking memory on long-running servers with many jobs. Added a 1 000-entry cap with eviction of already-set (completed) events when the cap is reached.

### Fixed — Frontend Correctness

- **`renderMarkdown` double-escaping code blocks**: `escHtml` was applied before fenced-code extraction, so code block content was HTML-escaped before the `` ``` `` regex ran, causing broken rendering. Rewrote `renderMarkdown` to extract fenced blocks into placeholders first, then HTML-escape the remaining text, then restore blocks.
- **`renderMarkdown` missing list support**: Bullet (`-` / `*`) and numbered (`1.`) lists rendered as plain text. Added regex-based list conversion.
- **`loadJobs` / `loadProviders` / `submitNewJob`**: Called `.json()` on responses without checking `res.ok`, silently swallowing HTTP errors. Added `res.ok` guards with user-visible error messages.
- **`handleEvent` STATUS re-renders**: `renderFilesPanel` was called on every status event (including transient `running` → `running` transitions), causing expensive DOM rebuilds. Changed to only call on terminal states (`completed` / `failed`).
- **`restart_job`**: New job was created without forwarding `rate_limit_action` from the original, defaulting all restarts to `"pause"` regardless of original intent. Fixed.
- **Stale `selectedProductPath` global**: Removed orphaned global variable; `openArtifactPath` now delegates to `_ftSelectFile` instead of performing stale DOM queries.

### Changed

- `statusColor` map in `renderExecutionPanel` now includes the `rate_limited` state.

### Added — UI/UX Design System Skill

A native Overlord11 UI/UX design system skill that gives agents a consistent,
reusable visual specification before any UI implementation begins.

#### Datasets (`skills/uiux/`)
- `skills/uiux/styles.json` — 10 vastly different UI styles with full layout,
  typography, shape, interaction, and Do/Don't guidance:
  `brutalist`, `glassmorphism`, `neobrutalism`, `editorial`, `minimal-zen`,
  `data-dense`, `soft-ui`, `retro-terminal`, `biomimetic`, `aurora-gradient`
- `skills/uiux/palettes.json` — 10 color palettes (light + dark modes) with
  14 semantic token hex values each and WCAG contrast notes:
  `midnight-ink`, `chalk-board`, `neon-city`, `nordic-frost`, `terracotta-sun`,
  `deep-forest`, `sakura-bloom`, `volcanic-night`, `arctic-monochrome`, `ultraviolet`

#### New Tool (`ui_design_system`)
- `tools/defs/ui_design_system.json` — provider-agnostic tool schema
- `tools/python/ui_design_system.py` — Python implementation
- Accepts: `style_id`, `palette_id`, `stack` (html-tailwind/html-css/react/nextjs/vue/svelte),
  `page`, `project_name`, `output_format` (md/json), `persist` (bool)
- Outputs: complete design spec (tokens, layout rules, typography, shapes, motion, Do/Don't,
  stack implementation code, Reviewer checklist)
- When `persist=true`: writes `design-system/MASTER.md` and optional per-page override
- Deterministic default selection: same project name always produces the same style+palette
- Style-palette affinity tables guide sensible default pairings

#### Agent Updates
- **Orchestrator** (`agents/orchestrator.md`): Added "UI/UX Feature Request" delegation
  pattern; Coder is instructed to generate/consult design system before UI work
- **Coder** (`agents/coder.md`): Added step 3 "UI/UX Check" — read `design-system/MASTER.md`
  or call `ui_design_system` with `persist=true` if missing; added UI token compliance to
  quality checklist; `ui_design_system` added to tool list
- **Reviewer** (`agents/reviewer.md`): Added "UI Design System Audit" workflow step;
  added full "UI Design System Checklist" section; added `ui_design_system` to tool list

#### Config Updates
- `config.json`: `ui_design_system` registered in `tools` section; added to Coder and
  Reviewer agent tool lists

#### Documentation
- `docs/UI-UX-Design-System.md` — comprehensive documentation: what the skill is,
  dataset structure, tool reference, CLI usage, persist/reuse patterns, style+palette
  combination guide, extending the skill, and troubleshooting
- `ONBOARDING.md`: Added "UI/UX Design System Skill" section with quick-start CLI
  examples and tool reference; added `ui_design_system` to tool table; added rule 15
  ("Use the design system for UI"); updated delegation patterns
- `README.md`: Added `🎨 UI/UX design system skill` feature bullet; updated tool count
  badge to 16; added `skills/uiux/` to directory structure; added `ui_design_system`
  to Analysis & Memory tools table; added `docs/UI-UX-Design-System.md` to docs listing

#### Tests
- `tests/test.py`: Added `test_ui_design_system` function with 6 tests covering:
  Markdown output, JSON output, default selection, persist to disk, invalid IDs,
  and error handling for missing data

---

### Added — Test Suite (`tests/test.py`)

A comprehensive test suite for all 16 Overlord11 modules was built and
hardened across multiple iterations. It is designed to be usable directly
by LLM agents as well as humans.

#### Coverage
- **81 tests** across 28 modules: read_file, write_file, list_directory,
  glob, search_file_content, run_shell_command, web_fetch, web_scraper,
  git_tool, calculator, save_memory, code_analyzer, project_scanner,
  publisher_tool, log_manager, session_manager
- Encoding edge-cases: UTF-8, CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean), emoji, empty
  files — all verified via roundtrip write/read
- Ripgrep + pure-Python fallback compatibility: JSON output format
  differences (`"type":"match"` vs `"type": "match"`) handled in all tests
- Web scraper tests call the actual `act_*` API (`act_validate_url`,
  `act_search`, `act_detect_type`, `act_extract_text`, `act_analyze_structure`,
  `act_find_feeds`) — no more SKIP returns

#### CLI flags
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--skip-web` | Skip internet-dependent tests |
| `--tool X[,Y,Z]` | Run one or more tools (comma-separated) |
| `--quiet` / `-q` | Summary + failures only — LLM/CI friendly |
| `--no-color` | Strip all ANSI codes; auto-applied when stdout is not a TTY |
| `--output PATH` | Write JSON results to a custom path |
| `--list` | Print available tool names and exit |
| `--fail-fast` | Abort on first failure |

#### Machine-readable JSON output (`tests/test_results.json`)
Every run emits a JSON file with a full `environment` block:
```json
{
  "environment": {
    "python_version": "3.x",
    "platform": "win32 | linux | darwin",
    "ripgrep": true,
    "packages": { "bs4": true, "requests": true, "ddgs": true, ... }
  }
}
```

#### `NO_COLOR` environment variable
Honoured at process startup (POSIX standard). Equivalent to `--no-color`.

### Fixed — `tools/python/search_file_content.py`
- Added `_find_rg()` — probes `rg` on `PATH` then common Windows install
  paths (Scoop, WinGet, Chocolatey, Cargo) before giving up
- Added `_python_search()` — pure-Python regex fallback producing
  ripgrep-compatible JSON-lines (`{"type":"begin",...}` / `{"type":"match",...}` /
  `{"type":"summary",...}`)
- `_RG_BIN` module-level cache — binary discovery happens once at import,
  not per call

### Fixed — `tools/python/publisher_tool.py`
- `log_tool_invocation(tool=...)` → `log_tool_invocation(tool_name=...)`
  (wrong keyword argument caused every publisher call to log an exception)
- `log_error(tool=...)` → `log_error(source=...)` (same root cause)

### Fixed — Windows console encoding (`tests/test.py`)
- Wrap `sys.stdout` / `sys.stderr` in `io.TextIOWrapper(..., encoding="utf-8")`
  at startup on `win32` to avoid `UnicodeEncodeError` on cp1252 consoles
- `safe_str()` helper encodes all output values through
  `encode("ascii", errors="backslashreplace")` as a final fallback
