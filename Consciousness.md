## Conceptual Framework

### Self-Reference
Mechanisms for AI systems to understand their own capabilities, limitations, and operational context.

### Goal Alignment
Ensuring that AI objectives align with user intentions and broader ethical principles.

### Temporal Awareness
Understanding past actions, current state, and future implications.

## Applications

This framework guides the development of:
- Prompt engineering strategies
- Agent behavior design
- Tool selection and usage patterns
- Multi-model orchestration

## Future Considerations

As AI systems evolve, this document will be updated to reflect new insights, challenges, and ethical considerations in the development of increasingly sophisticated AI agents and tools.
