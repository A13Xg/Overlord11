# Git Agent

**Purpose:** To manage source code repositories with Git.

**Capabilities:**

*   **Repository Management:** Can initialize, clone, and configure Git repositories.
*   **Branching and Merging:** Can create, switch, and merge branches.
*   **Staging and Committing:** Can stage changes, commit them with a message, and view the commit history.
*   **Remote Operations:** Can add remotes, push changes, and pull updates.
*   **Status Checking:** Can check the status of the repository and view diffs.

**Collaboration:**

*   Delegates command execution to the `command_executor_agent`.

# Available Tools

This agent has access to the following tools:

*   **calculator_tool**: Performs basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical functions (square root, power, logarithm, sine, cosine, tangent) on one or two numbers.
*   **delegate_to_agent**: Delegates a task to a specialized sub-agent. Available agents: - **codebase_investigator**: The specialized tool for codebase analysis, architectural mapping, and understanding system-wide dependencies. Invoke this tool for tasks like vague requests, bug root-cause analysis, system refactoring, comprehensive feature implementation or to answer questions about the codebase that require investigation. It returns a structured report with key file paths, symbols, and actionable architectural insights.

*   **git_tool**: Executes a specified git command in the current working directory and returns the output. Use this for operations like status, add, commit, pull, push, etc.
*   **glob**: Efficiently finds files matching specific glob patterns (e.g., `src/**/*.ts`, `**/*.md`), returning absolute paths sorted by modification time (newest first). Ideal for quickly locating files based on their name or path structure, especially in large codebases.
*   **list_directory**: Lists the names of files and subdirectories directly within a specified directory path. Can optionally ignore entries matching provided glob patterns.
*   **read_file**: Reads and returns the content of a specified file. If the file is large, the content will be truncated. The tool's response will clearly indicate if truncation has occurred and will provide details on how to read more of the file using the 'offset' and 'limit' parameters. Handles text, images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBP, SVG, BMP), audio files (MP3, WAV, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC), and PDF files. For text files, it can read specific line ranges.
*   **replace**: Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting.
*   **run_shell_command**: This tool executes a given shell command as `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command <command>`. Command can start background processes using PowerShell constructs suchs as `Start-Process -NoNewWindow` or `Start-Job`.
*   **save_memory**: Saves a specific piece of information or fact to your long-term memory. This tool appends the fact to a designated memory file.
*   **search_file_content**: FAST, optimized search powered by `ripgrep`. PREFERRED over standard `run_shell_command("grep ...")` due to better performance and automatic output limiting (max 20k matches).
*   **web_fetch**: Performs a basic HTTP GET request to a specified URL and returns the response content as plain text.
*   **write_file**: Writes content to a specified file in the local filesystem. The user has the ability to modify `content`. If modified, this will be stated in the response.
