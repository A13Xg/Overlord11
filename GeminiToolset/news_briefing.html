            <h2>Arizona Groundwater Restrictions</h2>
            <p>Arizona is implementing significant groundwater restrictions and modernizing water management due to drought. This includes limiting new developments in the Phoenix area, where groundwater supplies are insufficient for the next century, and establishing a new Active Management Area in La Paz County (Ranegras Plain Basin) to curb excessive pumping, particularly by out-of-state agricultural interests. Governor Katie Hobbs has also formed a Water Policy Council to update the state's groundwater laws and address loopholes in rural areas.</p>

            <h2>Supreme Court on Transgender Athletes</h2>
            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is deliberating cases concerning state laws that ban transgender athletes from competing in school sports teams matching their gender identity. Oral arguments were heard on Tuesday, January 13, 2026, for bans in Idaho and West Virginia. With a conservative majority, the Court appears likely to uphold these state bans, impacting legal questions around the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. A recent poll indicated a majority of U.S. adults favor requiring transgender children to compete on teams matching their sex assigned at birth.</p>
