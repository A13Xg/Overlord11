    "description": "This directory is an existing project. I want you to systematically go through it and get a solid understanding of what it does, and how it works. Note it does not use an API to access this website. It uses a custom URL with arguments to fetch a JSON page. I would like to make modifications and improvements to this project, but before that I want to initialize you and have you get a solid understanding of the code base while checking for errors, malformed or in-efficient code, and any functions or snippets that are not properly documented/commented.",

My primary goal is to gain a solid understanding of the codebase, identify errors, inefficiencies, and undocumented functions, and prepare for future modifications.\n\nThis request primarily falls under the **PLAN** phase, focusing on analysis and understanding of an *existing* project, rather than generating a new one from scratch.\n\nHer"
